# Kaggle-MNIST
##Testing Different Algorithms for MNIST dataset.
This dataset is from Kaggle's MNIST dataset. This was basically an exercise in
playing with different algorithms and approaches in R, to maximise my score.
I used:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. C5.0 Decision Tree with 10 Boosts
3. C5.0 Decision Tree with grid search (caret) and 10-fold cross validation
4. SVM
5. Random Forest with 10 times 10-fold cross validation with grid search (caret)
